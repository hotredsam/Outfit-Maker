#### Inspiration and/or Explain the App
Our inspiration was an eCommerce site, reflecting our anticipation that a major part of our future roles might involve developing eCommerce sites for clients. Specifically, we chose fashion, as we noticed a gap in the market for this unique concept. The app enables users to photograph their clothes, and it randomly assigns different outfits based on the images uploaded. A possible enhancement includes adding 3D-style images or animations to enhance the appearance of outfits, especially when the original photos are taken in poor lighting or are misaligned.

#### How to Use the App
1. **Create Items**: Upload images of different clothes (up to 10 images).
2. **View Items**: See a list of items uploaded.
3. **Create Outfits**: Manually match your outfits or use the random selector (if implemented).
4. **View Outfits**: Save and view all matched outfits.
