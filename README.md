Inspiration and/or explain the app (1-3 lines) - Inspiration was an ecommerce site, as a major part of our future roles could be developing eccommerce sites for clients. We decided on fashion as this is a major industry and we haven't seen this concept out there at all. So this is a unique concept. This app allows you to take photos of clothes in your closet and the app randomly assigns different outfits based on the images uploaded. As a bonus we may want to add an animation and 3D style image of the outfits so they look better, especially if these photos are taken in bad lighting or images may not be straight etc. 

How to use the app - To use the app you would 1 - create items - upload the images of the different clothes (Total 10 images), view items - this is a list of items uploaded, create outfits - you can also just match your outfits manually. View outfits - to save all outfits matched. As an addition if time permits, for the app we can create functionality to randomly select different outfits and color contract, on different matches. 

List the technologies - Express, node, react, Postgres SQL, trello, firebase, Figma and javascript, HTML and CSS. We used boostrap for look and feel.

We used Firebase for deployment
Multiple clothing links from H & M
We installed boostrap for visualization
We used video imagery listed as MP4 clothing file

Outstanding bugs and/or unfinished functionality - Login and Create account functionality was not 100% completed.
